 Description :  ARoF configuration application. This gets called by the ARoF Agent.
                Parameters are passed as arguments and are being forwarded to
                ARoF HW through? -> ARoF HW hasn't been fully described yet..
                This was brought to the plenary meeting in Eindhoven and decided to
                pass arof status (on/off) to a pin (3.3V LVTTL). Also pass this
                info to a on-board led for visualization of the arof status.
